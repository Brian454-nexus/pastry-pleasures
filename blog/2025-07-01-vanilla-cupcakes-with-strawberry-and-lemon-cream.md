If you have been following my journey, or if you know me personally, I am a huge fan of vanilla. I am not a sweet tooth but I have a certain liking for vanilla products. Even when buying someone scented candles or car freshener, my initial thought is always vanilla. I guess it’s sage to say I am sort of being safe with it, but i can’t deny it. Vanilla is very hard to ruin.

So whenever I am in a baking mood, and have no order, I always go for vanilla. The house is always smelling quite wonderful and the Pradip Vanilla has been nothing short of amazing since I used it the first time four years back.

So when trying these cupcakes out, I wanted to do something different to the cream, and the closest Pradip Flavor to me at that point was the Lemon Flavour. Citrus flavours around me are not that easy to come by and when you do, it either needs a whole 300ml to get the flavour right, or the alcohol content is just too much you are thus unable to use it. Obviously it would be impossible to add fresh lemon to whipped cream as it will churn the cream unto buttermilk. And no one wants that. So the Pradip Lemon Flavour comes in handy when looking for that citrus flavour for your cream. Trust me. It is fantastic.

> ***Ingredients – Makes 12 cupcakes***
>
> * 125 grams margarine
> * 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons granulated white sugar
> * 1/4 cup milk
> * 1/2 tablespoon oil based Pradip Clear Vanilla Essence.
> * 2 eggs
> * 3/4 teaspoon Pradip baking powder
> * 1 cup all-purpose flour
> * 1/4 cup Pradip Corn Flour
>
> ***For the toppings***
>
> * 1 & 1/2 cups whipping cream
> * 1/4 teaspoon Pradip Lemon flavour
> * 50 grams strawberries
> * 2 teaspoons granulated white Sugar
> * 1 tablespoon water

***Method***

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Line your cupcake tray with desired cupcake liners.

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder, corn flour and all-purpose flour (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs one at a time to the margarine mixture, until incorporated.

Add the Vanilla Essence.

Slowly add your flour mix and milk into the margarine and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared cupcake liners. Bake for 15 – 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Let the cupcakes cool completely before decorating.

***For the cream***

In a small saucepan, add the strawberries, hulled and halved. Add the sugar and water. Let them cook on low heat, stirring consistently until the strawberries soften. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.

Meanwhile, Pour the whipping cream into a bowl and add the lemon flavour. Whisk the cream to stiff peaks. Fold in the strawberries. This cream will have a sweet and citrus taste which is beyond lovely in my humble opinion. The strawberries will also give the cream a slightly pink colour that is equally amazing.

Decorate your cupcakes as desired.
