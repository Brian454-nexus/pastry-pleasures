I’m still doing this semesters exams and I am drained. Lucky for me, Christmas is getting closer and closer and yay! The weather is usually quite lovely at this time, perfectly warm and the best excuse to try out a dessert.

I have been thinking about trifles for the longest time lately but I unfortunately haven’t gotten round to making them. Luckily today I had some extra time on my hands and decided to make them for our dessert.

I used my [Vanilla Cake](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/vanilla-cake/) and the [Blueberry](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/blueberry-cake/)  puree to make the trifle. It’s quick and easy especially if you have guests coming over or if you are looking to spoil yourself because why not.

You will need:-

* Vanilla Cake
* 1 cup Whipping Cream
* 1/2 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla Essence
* Strawberries – cut into thin slices
* Blueberry Puree

For the whipping cream, pour it into a bowl, add vanilla essence and beat it to form stiff peaks. When ready, start assembling the trifle.

Cut the cake into bite size cubes.

Place them into serving glasses.

Using a spoon or a piping bag, add the whipping cream.

Add the strawberries and the blueberries. This will be dependent on how much you’d like to have.

Add more cake on top of the fruits.

Garnish with a generous amount of whipping cream and top with a strawberry or garnish of choice.
