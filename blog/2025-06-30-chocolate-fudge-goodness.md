Today is my sister’s wedding day!!! Yay. Overly excited about it cause this is the first wedding I will be attending where I am not working. Though i am not sure if having done the wedding cake and being a bridesmaid still counts as working ~~(so I basically got distracted mid sentence and it has been a week since the distraction :-D).~~

Fudge cake happens to be the most requested cake this past year and very many people ask for its recipe. It is an extremely easy cake to do, despite contrary belief. You basically whisk the magic into the oven and devour the amazing goodness that is a fudge cake.

My sister wanted a chocolate fudge cake for her wedding and I was quite skeptical about it. Living in the tropics means weather patterns can be unpredictable as it may be sunny one second and pouring cats and dogs the next. She remained adamant about what she wanted and I figured I had no choice but to respect her wishes. (She was a client after all).

Turns out it rained, then got really sunny and the cake held on so perfectly that I was basically dumbfounded to say the least.

Mix everything in one bowl until well combined, then, add the hot water and whisk quickly, being careful not to burn yourself.

If you add the hot water before the eggs are well mixed with other ingredients, the eggs may start to cook.

Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.
