I must admit, although I prefer cooler weather, keeping warm can be quite the challenge! But here’s a simple yet delightful remedy: **Bake a Cake!** 🍰✨ 

**A lemon cake**, to be precise! Not only will it fill your home with the heavenly scent of citrus, but you’ll also get to enjoy the sweet rewards of your effort. Imagine indulging in a slice while sipping a warm cup of tea or coffee. ☕️🍋

And just to elevate the experience, I’ve added chocolate chips to mine because, well, chocolate makes everything better! 😍 Trust me on this one; it’s the perfect way to cozy up during these cold days. 

Stay warm and happy baking! 🎉

#### Method

1. **Preheat and Prepare**\
   Preheat your oven to **180°C** (350°F). Grease and dust your baking tin to prevent sticking.
2. **Sift Dry Ingredients**\
   In a large bowl, sift together the **all-purpose flour** and **baking powder**. This step is crucial as it ensures the leavening agent is well incorporated. Add the **lemon zest** to this mixture.
3. **Curdle the Milk**\
   In a separate jug, combine the **milk** and **lemon juice**. Allow it to sit for a moment—it will curdle, and that’s completely fine!
4. **Cream Butter and Sugar**\
   In another bowl, soften your **butter or margarine** using a mixer or spatula. Add in the **sugar** and mix until the texture transforms from yellow and heavy to a pale, fluffy consistency. This step will significantly affect the final texture of your cake.
5. **Add Eggs**\
   Add the **eggs** one at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, mixing well after each addition.
6. **Combine Mixtures**\
   Gradually incorporate the flour mixture and the milk mixture into the butter-egg mix. Alternate adding them—beginning and ending with the flour. This helps to incorporate air, resulting in a lighter cake.
7. **Bake**\
   Pour the batter into your prepared baking tin and bake for **40-50 minutes**. If you prefer making **cupcakes**, divide the batter into **24 cupcake cases** and bake for **18-25 minutes**.
8. **Final Touches**\
   Avoid opening the oven door before the baking time is up. Once baked, let your cake cool and decorate it as desired.
