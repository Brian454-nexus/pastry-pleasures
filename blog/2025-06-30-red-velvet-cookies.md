We are officially done with January. Yay! All of us are finally free of January jokes and Iâ€™m sure plenty of Bakerâ€™s and service providers can finally breathe a sigh of relief. I know I am.

I technically didnâ€™t want January to end, cause I know the workload ahead of me is plentiful. Iâ€™m excited for all the challenges and jobs Iâ€™m about to undertake, but at the same time I Sam a professional procrastinator with a fear of failing ðŸ˜«. So Iâ€™ll need to be on my toes all the time. (Yay).

Itâ€™s now February so technically we are counting down days to Valentineâ€™s Day, and it will be here before we know it. So why not make cookies as we count down the days to Valentineâ€™s.

They are pretty yum cookies with a nice chewy velvety texture. Guaranteed to be eaten in one sitting.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> 1. 250 grams margarine
> 2. 75 grams caster sugar
> 3. 15o grams all-purpose flour
> 4. 50 grams Pradip Corn Flour
> 5. 50 grams Pradip Cocoa Powder
> 6. 1 and 1/2 teaspoons Pradip baking powder
> 7. 1/2 teaspoon Pradip Powder Red food colour â€“ 4R
> 8. 4 teaspoons milk
> 9. 1 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla

***Method***

Pre-heat your oven at 180 degrees Celsius

Grease a baking sheet and place grease proof/parchment paper on it. Alternatively grease and dust the baking sheetÂ with flour.

In a bowl, sift the all purpose flour, corn flour, cocoa powder, powder colour and baking powder together.

In a second bowl, soften the butter and add the caster sugar to it, until pale and fluffy.

When the margarine and sugar are well mixed, add the flour mix and the pradip vanilla and milk and mix until everything is well combined.

Scoop a tablespoon or less or more and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hand, place on the baking sheet. Do this with all the cookie dough. Should give 12-30 cookies depending on the preferred size. You can also opt to use a piping bag, with or without a nozzle.

Bake for 15-20 minutes. The edges of the cookies should be firm and the centre soft to touch, while removing.

Set aside to cool as they firm up. Drizzle some melted white chocolate as a garnish.
