To be fairly honest, this recipe happened by mistake. My red velvet [recipe](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/slice-of-love/) has always worked and I have never had a need to change it. Then last month, I sat for my master’s exams, and got slightly disoriented while working on a cupcake order, I added double the amount of buttermilk that was required, and had a bit of a panic attack when I realised it. My first instinct was to redo the cupcakes when that batch comes out because no one wants a soggy cupcake.

When these babies came out of the oven, they were super moist and had risen oh so beautifully, that i couldn’t resist sharing them. This has now been my go to red velvet cupcake recipe and topping it with dark chocolate ganache brings in a whole new level of decadence that I am living for!!

***Method***

Preheat your oven at 180°Celsius.

Line your cupcake tray with cupcake liners.

In one bowl, sift/whisk together the baking powder, red food colour, bicarbonate, cocoa powder, corn flour and all-purpose flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs to the margarine mixture, until incorporated.

Add the Vanilla Essence.

Slowly add your flour mix and buttermilk into the margarine and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, scoop about 1 tablespoon of the cake batter into the cupcake tray and bake the cupcakes for 20 minutes.

Let the cupcakes cool for at least 1hr, before decorating with dark chocolate ganache.
