I know people always complain about how long January is, but, have have they experienced March yet? This March has been especially long. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m happy with the workload, but being constantly exhausted drains my heart and soul. Iâ€™m longing for a coastal holiday. Would you like to come with?

My favourite part about being on holiday is the buffet breakfast! I would never miss it despite the circumstances. I love pancakes (or crepes depending on where youâ€™re from) and I have especially been longing for the coconut pancakes.

These coconut crepes are especially easy to make and donâ€™t get me started on taste!!! Youâ€™re going to devour all of them in a split second.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 1.5 cups all purpose flour
> * 1/4 teaspoon salt
> * 3 tablespoons white sugar
> * 1/2 cup Pradip desiccated coconut
> * 1.5 cups milk
> * 2 tablespoons oil
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip vanilla
> * 2 eggs



***Method***

In a deep bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, sugar and desiccated coconut.

In a second bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, vanilla and eggs. Whisk until well combined.

Make a well in the middle of the bowl of dry ingredients. Add the wet ingredients. Whisk thoroughly until there are no lumps.

Heat up your frying pan and add 1tablespoon of oil.

Spread the oil with a serviette. This will also help remove excess oil. Pour one scoop of the crepe batter onto the pan and swirl the pan to spread it. Let the pancake cook on medium heat for about 2 minuets on each side. Repeat with the rest of the batter.
