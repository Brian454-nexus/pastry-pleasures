On the 5th Day of Christmas, we made a White Forest Cake.

Sponge cakes are literally my sister’s go-to cake and she always gasses me up to make her one or recommends everyone to try the white forest.

When I partnered with Pembe Flour for the Christmas period, I knew I wanted to share recipes that would be easy to make and would go well with family members. Something my sister would make for her guests basically. So I went with the white forest cake.

It’s pretty easy to make and always makes for a wonderful dessert that is loved by most, if not all.

> ***Ingredients – make an 8″ cake or 1 kg cake***
>
> ***For the cake***
>
> * 7 eggs
> * 1 cup sugar
> * 1 cup pembe flour
> * 1 teaspoon baking powder
>
> ***For moistening***
>
> * Simple Syrup
>
> ***For filling and garnishing***
>
> * White Chocoalte for garnishing
> * 2 cups whipping cream
> * Strawberries or Cherries

***Method***

* Preheat oven to 180C
* Grease and line baking sheet with greaseproof paper
* Sift the flour and baking powder together and set aside.
* Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Place the egg whites in a large bowl and the yolks in a smaller bowl.
* Whisk the egg whites until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Use a metal spoon to test if ready by scooping the whites and turning the spoon upside down. If the eggs don’t fall, it’s ready.
* Add the yolks and whisk thoroughly
* Add the sugar and whisk thoroughly
* Add the flour mixture a little at a time using the folding in method to ensure a lot of air is in the cake batter.
* Pour into the prepared baking pan and bake for 40 minutes or until knife test is clean
* Once ready set it aside to cool for 1hr before decorating

***To Decorate***

* When cake is cool whisk the whipping cream until stiff peaks.
* Cut the cake into two or three layers and moisten each layer with the juice until the cakes are well moistened.
* Pour some whipped cream onto one layer and smoothen it. Then place some chopped strawberries on top.
* Then place the other layer and decorate with remaining whipped cream. Use the white chocolate to garnish and place some of the strawberries to finish up the look
