I have been having really bad migraines for the past few days making it really hard to do anything :-(.  However, I find it calming and relaxing to work on something different when having migraines as it gets my mind off of it.

I have been meaning to try out a doughnut recipe that will come wonderful and nice, and finally it has worked. I owe my friend a lifetime of doughnuts because of a silly bet we had ~~(of course I lost)~~ and the reviews i got about these doughnuts from him was nothing short of how wonderful they are and his office and family want more doughnuts.

So why not share this wonderful recipe with you. It’s extremely simple and the doughnuts come out light and fluffy. Everyone will want to move in to have some.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> ***For the Doughnuts***
>
> * 4 cups all purpose flour (plus extra for kneading and rolling)
> * 2 cups Pradip Corn Starch
> * 1/2 cup Granulated White Sugar (add or reduce to your liking)
> * 20 grams Yeast
> * 4 eggs
> * 1 cup warm milk
> * 1 cup warm water
> * 150 grams margarine melted and cooled
> * 1 tablespoon Pradip Vanilla Essence
>
> ***For the Glaze (Optional)***
>
> * 50 grams White/Dark Chocolate
> * 8 tablespoons icing sugar
> * Water
> * 2 tablespoons margarine
> * Sprinkles

***Method***

In a bowl, sift together the corn flour and the all purpose flour to remove any lumps. Divide the mix into two.

Add the sugar into one of the four mixtures. Stir until well combined.

Add the melted margarine and stir.

Add the eggs and the yeast to the flour mix. Combine thoroughly to ensure the eggs are well mixed in as this could lead them to start cooking when the warm milk is added. (You wouldn’t want doughnuts that smell of boiled eggs.

Add the milk, Pradip vanilla essence and water and stir until well combined. The mixture may be a bit runny at this point so add more flour  from the one you had separated until you’re able to knead it.

Knead until the dough no longer sticks to your hands or countertop

Put your dough in a bowl, cover with a wet towel or cling film, and leave it somewhere warm to proof/bloom. Should take 40-60 minutes to bloom.

During the cold weather, it may be hard to get a warm place to proof your dough, so you can improvise using a sufuria with hot water.

When proofing time is done, the dough will have doubled in volume, and will be really soft to touch.

Punch the center of the dough. It helps release the air that is in the dough.

Dust your surface with flour and roll the doughnut dough to your desired thickness. Using a doughnut cutter, cut into shape and let the doughnuts proof again for 15 minutes before frying. If you don’t have a doughnut cutter, one can use a cup and bottle top to shape the doughnuts.

Deep fry and let them cool for a bit before glazing.

***Making the Glaze***

In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and the margarine together.

In a second bowl, sift the icing sugar and add water, a little at a time, ensuring until the mix is thick and a little runny.

Add the icing sugar to the melted chocolate and dip the doughnuts. If adding sprinkles, sprinkle on to the glazed doughnut immediately as it dries quickly.
