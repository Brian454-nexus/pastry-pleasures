I am basically extremely sleep deprived. I have not slept longer than 4.5 hrs in the past two weeks. Tempted to hibernate in this cold weather but I unfortunately have exams starting on Tuesday. Someone should stop time and allow me to sleep long enough to start studying without losing time. ðŸ˜¦

My fingers hurt after this

Anyways, as much as I am exhausted, I had the pleasure of baking one of my most frequent/favourite clientâ€™s wedding. Everything about the wedding was more than glorious. I wanted to carry the food they served, I wanted the centerpieces. It was an extremely gorgeous wedding.

why wouldnâ€™t anyone want this to keep at home

The bride is an extremely lovely lady, and she had the idea to have close to 5 different cake flavours to serve her guests. So for now we start with Pineapple flavour, which was in cupcake and table cakes that they served.

They are Lovely

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour (refer toÂ [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/)Â for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or a spatula.Â Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.Â Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.Â Add the Pradip Pineapple essence.

Add the sliced pineapple

Mix the pineapple juice and milk together. Slowly add your flour mix and milk into the margarineÂ and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cupcakes lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

When everything is well incorporated, use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to evenly distribute the mix into the cupcake sheet. Bake for 18 â€“ 20 Minutes. You can also check for readiness by inserting a cake tester or a toothpick in the center of a cupcake, if the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are ready.
