I have become addicted to fluffy pancakes. Never had I thought that this would be something I can admit. Mostly because they are ready faster than crepes but also because they are more versatile than my regular flat pancakes.

My Dad’s birthday was on Thursday so since he’s not a cake person I had to make him something. Blueberry pancakes was first in mind as he loves fruits and pancakes, so despite the January blues, I was up by 4am to make them for him. They turned out too great. You should definitely make them for a loved one.

Preheat your pan for about a minute, then add about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. 

Pour about a 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto your pan and let it cook for 2 minutes before flipping to cook through. 

Serve them warm.
