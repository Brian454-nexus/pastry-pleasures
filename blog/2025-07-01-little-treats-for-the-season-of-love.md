Ever just wanted to wake up in the morning and someone made you something sweet and delicious.

Well, these mini cakes could just be what you need. They are quite easy to make and best of all, THEY ARE RED VELVET.

It’s the season of love and if you have no one to share these with, that’s quite alright, you can eat them by yourself because we don’t judge here and self love is the best kind of love. It is also mandatory. So let’s indulge.

I know there’s just a bit too many [Pradip](https://www.facebook.com/PradipEL/) products in this recipe. But trust me, they are far to good to skip on, plus quite cost friendly. So hit them up for the products and let’s get baking.

***Ingredients (makes 1.5kg/9-10 inch cake or 36cupcakes)***

> * 375g margarine
> * 1&1/2 cup granulated white sugar
> * 6 eggs
> * 1&1/2 cup buttermilk
> * 1&1/2 tablespoon Pradip Vanilla essence
> * 3 cups all-purpose flour
> * 1/4 plus 1/8 cup Pradip Corn Flour
> * 1/4 plus 1/8  cup Pradip Cocoa Powder
> * 3/4 teaspoon bicarbonate soda
> * 2&1/4 teaspoon Pradip baking Powder
> * 3/4 teaspoon Pradip Powder Red food colour

***Method***

Preheat your oven at 180 degrees Celsius

Grease and line your baking tray

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder, red food colour, bicarbonate, cocoa powder, corn flour and all-purpose flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs one at a time to the margarine mixture, until incorporated.

Add the Vanilla Essence.

Slowly add your flour mix and buttermilk into the margarine and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared baking tray and back for 30-40 minutes

Let the cake cool for at least 3hrs then refrigerate it for a bit.

Remove the cake from the fridge and let grab a cutter, and make the cake layers.

Fill each layer with cream while stacking them up. Ensure to add a skewer to the mini cakes, especially if they are above two layers as they may be prone to falling.

Garnish and decorate as desired.

Enjoy the mini cakes with your loved one(s) or with the one you love most (yourself).
