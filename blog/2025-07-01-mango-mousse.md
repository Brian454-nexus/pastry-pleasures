On the 10th Day of Christmas, we made a mango mousse.

Well, it is mango season here at home and we all know those coastal mangoes are going to be in our fruit baskets and meals all through the year. So what better time than this festive season to start playing with them?

If you’re afraid the mangoes may be a little tart, add the Pradip mango flavour, and trust me, the tartness is definitely going to go away.

This is quite a light dessert that will definitely go with the summer season.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip Gelatin
> * 1 tablespoon room temperature water
> * 1 tablespoon warm water
> * 2 Cups diced mango
> * ½ teaspoon pradip mango flavour
> * ½ cup whipped cream – stiff peaks
> * 8 tablespoons water

***Method***

* Stir the gelatin in the room temperature water,
* Let it sit for 5 minutes to bloom the gelatin. Once the gelatin is bloomed, it will not move from the bowl.
* Add the bloomed gelatin into the warm water, and stir to dissolve
* In a blender, add the mango, pradip flavor, the dissolved gelatin and the water.
* Blend until smooth.
* Add the puree mix into a bowl and fold in the whipping cream.
* Add extra diced mango.
* Pour the mousse into serving glasses and let it sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving.
