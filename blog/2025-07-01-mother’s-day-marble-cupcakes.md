Mother’s Day is right around the corner, (literally 3 days away), and whats sweeter than a cupcake bouquet?\
My Mom is a lover of marble cupcakes, and I remember we had them almost every day, as kids, with tea or on road trips, or for school snacks.

So this year, why not return the favour to her, and bake her some marble cupcakes, decorated as a cupcake bouquet!

***Method***

Preheat your oven at 180°Celsius.

Line your cupcake tray with cupcake liners.

In one bowl, sift/whisk together the baking powder and all-purpose flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs to the margarine mixture, until incorporated.

Add the Vanilla Essence.

Slowly add your flour mix and milk into the margarine and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, divide the cupcake batter into two. Add cocoa butter to one of the portions and mix well.

Scoop both batters into the cupcake tray and bake the cupcakes for 20 minutes.

Once the cupcakes are cool,

Spread some glucose syrup on one corner of a cake board. Place around 7 cupcakes on the syrup. This will ensure the cupcakes don’t move around.

Below the cupcakes, place some fondant “stems” on the board. Add a fondant ribbon/bow.

Decorate the cupcakes with rosettes, and add little accents of choice.

Don’t forget to add the message on to the board.

Surprise your momma!
