I love the cold weather. I love being in warm hoodies and socks 24hrs a day as thats extra comfy and let’s be honest, no one looks bad in a baggy hoodie!!

The weather here has gone in extremes, we went through a couple of days with extreme heat then one afternoon its started raining and it’s yet to stop. The hardest bit for me is the cold. No matter how much you bundle up at night, I seem to be constantly freezing. Either I’m unwell, or the weather I just wasn’t mentally prepared for the cold weather.

So to warm up the house, what’s better than baking a batch of cupcakes. Your house will smell fantastic, the kitchen will be warm, and no one is unhappy eating a cupcake!

My favourite thing about this recipe is how well the strawberry filling blends with the chocolate cupcakes! It’s a match made in heaven!

> ***Ingredients***
>
> ***For the cupcakes***
>
> * 125g Margarine/butter
> * 1/2 cup granulated white sugar
> * 2 eggs
> * 1 cup all purpose Flour
> * 1/4 cup Pradip Cocoa powder
> * 3/4 teaspoon Pradip Baking powder
> * 1/4 teaspoon Pradip Bicarbonate Soda
> * 1/2 cup buttermilk(mala)
>
> ***For the filling***
>
> * 180g Strawberries
> * 10g caster sugar
> * 1 tablespoon water
> * 1/4 teaspoon Pradip strawberry essence
> * 1 tablespoon Pradip Cornflour.

***Method***

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Add your cupcake liners to the cupcake tray

In one bowl, sift together the cocoa, bicarbonate, baking powder, coffee, and all purpose flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together). It is really important to sift the cocoa because it has loads of lumps in it and they harden in the oven.

In a second bowl, soften your butter or margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugars and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.

Slowly add your flour mix and buttermilk into the butter and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cupcakes lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared cupcake liners – I use an ice-cream scoop – and

 

bake for 20minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

***For the Filling***

Put the strawberries, the sugar and the water in a pan and let them come to a boil on low heat. Stir consistently to avoid the puree sticking to the pan and burning. When the strawberries have softened and the liquid has almost doubled, remove from heat. Add cornflour and stir well to avoid lumping. If the pure is too thick for you liking, add a tablespoon of water. Set aside to cool.

When the cupcakes are ready and cooled, cut a little hole in the middle then add some strawberry filling. Garnish with whipped cream and chocolate covered strawberries.
