It’s finally Christmas. Genuinely can’t believe that we just have a week left to end the year. 

I’m more than elated for the new beginnings and for the opportunities that 2017 will have to offer. 

This Christmas (and every other for the past ten years) my family and I will be spending it in coast. I’m a huge fan of being at the beach.  Time to relax, get nothing done and eat unreasonably. I love it. 

My sister will be spending Christmas with her husband so I thought I’d make her a tropical cake before we left for Christmas.

> ***Ingredients*** 
>
> * 250g margarine 
> * 1&1/2 cups sugar
> * 2&1/2 cups flour
> * 1&1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip pineapple essence
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip coconut essence
> * 3/4 cup coconut milk
> * 1/2 cup pineapple chunks (cut into small pieces)
> * 4 eggs

***Method***

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.\
Grease and dust your baking tins.\
In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour.

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.\
Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.\
Add the Pradip coconut & pineapple Essence.\
Add the pineapple chunks

Slowly add your flour mix and buttermilk into the butter and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared baking tins and bake the 50 minutes.

Let the cake cool and decorate as desired.
