> Did you hear about the angry pancake? He just flipped! – Anonymous

I love pancakes. I can literally have pancakes everyday for the rest of my life and not get bored with them. For literally the last ten years, I have not missed pancakes during Christmas breakfast. We can call it an tradition now.

Since childhood, we have always referred to these beautifully thin flat cakes as pancakes, but we have somewhat migrated to calling them crepes now. But in many Kenyan households, they will forever remain to be called pancakes.

It’s now 8 days to Christmas and I genuinely cannot wait for christmas morning to have pancakes. So I woke up early and made my family some pancake, basically preparing ourselves for christmas breakfast.

> ***Ingredients*** 
>
> * 5 cups all purpose flour
> * 1 cup Pradip corn flour
> * 1 cup sugar (can add or reduce)
> * 1/2 teaspoon salt
> * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
> * 3.5 cups water (can substitute with milk)
> * 1 teaspoon pradip vanilla essence
> * 3 eggs

***Preparation***

Sift the corn flour and the all purpose flour, set aside. The corn flour makes the pancakes much lighter so I highly recommend using it.

In a second bowl, whisk together the oil, milk, vanilla essence and the eggs until well combined.

Add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix properly. Add water a little at a time while whisking the batter. Keep adding the water until the batter is runny and no lumps are left. I use my hand mixer with the whisk attachments at this point. Keep adding the water until the mix is runny.

Heat your pan and put about a tablespoon of oil, swirling the pan to grease it all over.

Pour about half a cup of the batter onto the pan spread it to ensure it’s thin. If you want them thinner, pour less batter and spread it.  ![img_8897](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_8897.jpg?w=750)

Let it heat up for about 1 or 2 minutes before flipping it. If you keep it on  the heat too long it becomes hard. Once you flip it, let it cook for about a minute and remove from the pan.

Do this with the rest of your batter ~~and if you’re like me, start eating before the rest are ready.~~
