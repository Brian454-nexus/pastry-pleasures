I legitimately thought I already had a chocolate chip blog post up. It just seems like one of those recipes that would have been the first that I shared. But, it’s never too late to make share these! the cookies are pretty simple, literally take no time to prep and are ready in no time!

> 1. 250 grams margarine
> 2. 1/2 cup caster sugar

> 4. 1 and 1/2 teaspoons Pradip baking powder
> 5. 1 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla Essence
> 6. 2 teaspoons milk

In a bowl, soften the margarine and then add the caster sugar to it. Mix until pale and fluffy.

When the margarine and sugar are well mixed, add the milk and vanilla essence. Mix until incorporated.

Add 1 cup flour and the baking powder to the mix, and continue mixing until incorporated. Add the remaining flour and the chocolate chips, then mix until everything is well incorporated.

Cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate the cookie mix for 30 minutes.

Pre-heat your oven at 180° Celsius

Grease a baking sheet and place grease proof/parchment paper on it.

Scoop a tablespoon or less or more and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hand, place on the baking sheet. Do this with all the cookie dough. Should give 12-30 cookies depending on the preferred size.

Bake for 15-20 minutes. The edges of the cookies should be firm and the center soft to touch, while removing.

Set aside to cool as they firm up.
