**Good day, ladies and gentlemen!**\
I’m finally back from my blogging hiatus. The silence here was purely due to time constraints — business has been booming lately (not complaining one bit!). But I’m back now, and I promise to post regularly going forward.

Growing up, my mother always baked vanilla cakes for our birthdays. Even when we went shopping for cupcakes — whether for school breaks or travel — vanilla was the default. It became tradition, and I quickly fell in love with all things vanilla.

### **The Quest for the Perfect Vanilla Cake**

So when I started baking professionally, my first mission was to develop a good — if not perfect — vanilla cake recipe.

My mum never used measurements; she baked from intuition, and somehow it always turned out right. I inherited her passion for baking — but mixed it with my dad’s love for precision. So "kubahatisha" (eyeballing) was a no-go for me. I needed exact recipes, perfect ingredients, and consistent results.

That’s where my vanilla journey began.

### **The Secret Ingredient? Pradip!**

I tried every supermarket vanilla essence available. None of them delivered the nostalgic flavour I remembered from my childhood.

Then, a friend of my mum’s recommended I visit **Walibhai in town**. The gentleman at the counter handed me a bottle of **Pradip Clear Vanilla Essence** and explained how to use it.

That day changed everything.

Pradip later improved their essence from water-based to **oil-based**, making the flavour stronger and more concentrated. You don’t need much — a little goes a long way!

### **My Go-To Vanilla Cake Recipe**

*Makes one 8-inch cake (~1kg)*

#### **Ingredients**

* 250g margarine
* 1 ½ cups sugar
* ½ cup + 2 tbsp milk

### **Preparation Steps**

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C.
2. Grease and dust your baking tins.
3. In one bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.
4. In a second bowl, soften the margarine. Add sugar and beat until smooth.
5. Add eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, mixing after each.
6. Stir in the Pradip Vanilla Essence.
7. Alternate adding the flour mix and milk into the batter — start and end with flour. This helps trap air, making the cake fluffier.
8. Pour into baking tins and bake for 50 minutes.
9. Let cool for at least 3 hours before icing.

### **Decorating**

* Add 1 tsp Pradip Clear Vanilla Essence to your whipping cream.
* Whip to stiff peaks.
* Decorate with a 1M nozzle or any other tip of choice.
* Add food colouring for a personal touch!
