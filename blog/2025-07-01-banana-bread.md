To be extremely honest, I am quite an avid bread eater. I like bread in each and every way (except when it’s “toasted” into a block of wood!), I can have bread for breakfast lunch and dinner. and still be in love with it.

The first time I heard of Banana Bread, my first thought was YUCK!! I don’t like bananas. I eat them maybe once every few weeks or months. I find bananas bland. And the fact that they can get spoilt in the blink of an eye just makes me disinterested in them as soon as I see them.

My mum has a farm and a few days back, she brought home plenty of bananas that she hadn’t sold at the market. Since I don’t want to eat them and because I hate being lectured (especially about not eating bananas), I had to find a way to kinda get rid of them. And what other way can a baker find to get rid of bananas than to make banana bread.

Its pretty simple to make and it is an excellent breakfast treat. My mum and dad LOVED it and have now promised to bring more bananas home to make banana bread. we may not be buying bread for a while if I’m correct.
