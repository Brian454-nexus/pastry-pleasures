I have genuinely been ~~waiting~~  dying to do this cake and blog about it. Unfortunately time has not been on my side. It’s like days have four hours nowadays as opposed to the regular twenty four.

Fortunately, one of my favourite clients ordered for it. And she gave me leeway to decorate it as I choose. It was to be a surprise to both her and the beautiful lady they were surprising.

To top it all she wanted the cookies and cream cake to be chocolate flavour.

So here’s the recipe.

Disclaimer:- Contains a lot of chocolate and oreos, but who’s complaining?!

**Ingredients *(makes 1Kg cake)***

* 250 grams margarine/butter
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/8 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup buttermilk/mala
* 4 eggs
* 1 & 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate
* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup cocoa (Use good quality cocoa like in the pic below)
* 100 grams lightly  crushed oreos (can add or reduce to your liking)

 

**Method**

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Grease and dust your baking tins (I’m using to 10 inch tins and two 6 inch tins as I will be stacking them)

Grease

And dust with all purpose.

In one bowl, sift together the cocoa, bicarbonate, baking powder and flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together). It is really important to sift the cocoa because it has loads of lumps in it and they harden in the oven.

In a second bowl, soften your butter or margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.

Add Half or all the oreos. Depends on your liking

Slowly add your flour mix and buttermilk into the butter and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Should look like this

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared baking tins and bake the 50 minutes.

Let the cake cool for at least 3hrs before icing it.

Use [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/blueberry-cake/) fudge icing only excluding the blueberry puree, and substituting the white chocolate with dark chocolate.

For the assembly, slice the cake into  preferred layers, and add a preffered amount of icing onto one layer

Fill in with oreos

Drooling already

Place the second layer and do a crumb coat.

![IMG_7444](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/img_7444.jpg?w=750)

Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes for the crumbcoat to set.

Ice the cake well And decorate as desired
