On the 9th Day of Christmas, we made some Lemon cupcakes.

These things are all the range. They are super moist and so flavourful. Literally takes no time to prep and are baked in no time. You can literally whip these up in the morning and not only have a house smelling so yum but also have them right up for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, just any time!

Using Pembe Home Baking Flour, the cupcakes came out so light and fluffy thus making them the perfect treat especially if you’ll be having guests over for Christmas.

* Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients
