The weekend is almost upon us, and what better way to start your weekend than to have brunch?

In my humble opinion, it’s not brunch or a buffet breakfast if there’s no eggs, pancakes and banana bread. I AM A BANANA BREAD JUNKIE. I am salivating right now and can literally smell banana bread baking just with the thought that i may possibly have it this weekend. (or maybe I should just bake one later tonight?)

My absolute favourite thing about banana bread is just how easy it is to make. Literally in under 8 minutes, you’ll have popped it into the oven!!

So here we go…

> * 2 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla essence
