Hello,

Happy New Year!!

It’s been forever. I know, and I am genuinely sorry. I got overwhelmed with work and pushed the next post to next week, which turned into next month and with the blink of an eye we were already in 2018. I am sorry.

2017 was a little overwhelming. With many ups and downs. But with it, came many lessons. I got to interact with more clients, brides and students in the span of 12 months than I had ever imagined I ever would. I was grateful to meet each and everyone of them (you) especially those who had nothing but kind words and lessons for me.

Hopefully, this year will be greater and I will remember to post more consistently.

To kick us off, lets enjoy this summer weather with a very moist Pina Colada cake.

I’m using the Pradip range of products (as usual) because they have never failed me and I can assure you the flavours are so rich, you’ll be dreaming of them. Check out their page for more on the varieties they have and to contact them: @ [Pradip](https://www.facebook.com/PradipEL/?ref=bookmarks)

***Method***

***Cake***

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Grease and line your baking tin(s) with grease proof paper.

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, measure your sugar.

In a separate bowl, separate the egg whites from the yolk. Pour the egg whites into a large bowl and the yolks into a smaller container. (Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/dCyuUXjCkL4) on our channel for clear instructions, – Don’t forget to subscribe)

Whisk the egg whites until fluffy, and stiff peaks form. Use a metallic spoon to test if ready by scooping the egg whites and turning the spoon upside down, if the eggs don’t fall, it’s ready. Do not stop whisking while testing.

Add the yolks and continue to whisk thoroughly.

Add the sugar and whisk thoroughly.

Add the pineapple and coconut essence.

Add the flour mixture a little at a time using the folding in method. This ensures that a lot of air is incorporated into the cake batter, while also not deflating the fluffy egg whites.

Pour into the prepared baking tin(s) and bake for 40 minutes – if using one tin, if using 2 tins, bake for 25-30 minutes – or until knife test is clean.

Once ready set it aside to cool for at least 1hr before decorating.

***Decoration***

Whisk the whipping cream into stiff peaks. (I use non dairy cream. If using dairy cream, be careful not to over mix as this will lead to curdling of the cream).

Mix pineapple juice and coconut liqour in a bowl to be used for moistening the cakes.

Cut the cake into two (or three) layers – if baked in one tin – and moisten each layer with the juice until the cakes are well moistened (not soggy).

Decorate the cake as desired, using the diced pineapples and desiccated coconut as a filling and for garnish.
