We cannot be more grateful for the support you constantly give us. Pastry Pleasures has grown tremendously in the years that it has been running and this has been due to the wonderful business that you give to us.

We appreciate it so much and we cannot say Thank you enough times to prove it.

However, after a year running in South B, we are moving. Pastry pleasures keeps growing on a daily basis and thus we need to upgrade our business.

With the digital age, we are happy to constantly serve all our clients from all over the country and even those from as far as Europe and America. We are always happy to be at your beck and call to make your moments as memorable as they always are.

With this in mind, Pastry Pleasures is going digital. We will be based fully online, with the option of pick ups and deliveries every day.

We thank you for growing with us.

Have a blessed week ahead.
