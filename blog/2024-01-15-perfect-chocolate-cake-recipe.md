### Instructions

#### 1. Prepare the Sweet Syrup

Start by crafting your syrup. In a bowl, mix the sugar with hot water until fully dissolved and then stir in the vanilla. Set this delicious concoction aside – it’ll add a lovely touch of sweetness later on! For the strawberries, sprinkle them with 2 tbsp of sugar, cover, and pop them in the fridge to macerate. This will result in juicy goodness for your cake layers.

#### 2. Set the Scene

Preheat your oven to 170°C (340°F). Take two 8” round pans, grease and line them with parchment paper, then give the parchment a light dusting of flour. 

#### 3. Sift with Love

In a mixing bowl, sift together the cake flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder three times. This step ensures those dry ingredients are perfectly aerated – a fluffy cake is just a few sieves away! Add the salt and set this mixture aside.

#### 4. Create a Double Boiler Magic

Place butter and milk in a small heatproof bowl, and prepare a saucepan filled a quarter full with water. Bring the water to a gentle simmer – we’re going to transform this into a double boiler shortly.

#### 5. Beat the Eggs to Perfection

In a large bowl, combine eggs and fine caster sugar. Beat them with a hand mixer for about 1 minute, then place the bowl over your steaming water. Continue beating for 3 minutes until thickened. Remove from the heat and turn off the burner. Place the butter and milk mixture in the hot water to melt gently, being careful that no water gets into the bowl.

#### 6. Fold with Grace

Keep beating your egg mixture for another 5 minutes until it’s thick and luscious. Now, using a hand whisk, give it a few quick stirs to make sure everything is perfectly combined. 

Next, sift the dry ingredients over the egg mixture – all of it! With a spatula, fold the flour in using long, gentle strokes. Remember to count the strokes; keep them under 40 to maintain that airy texture! Then, add the vanilla along with the melted butter and milk, folding again with a light hand, this time not exceeding 60 strokes.

#### 7. Bake with Care

Pour the luscious batter into your prepared pans and gently tap them on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles. Bake in your preheated oven for about 23-25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remember, be cautious – we don’t want to overbake! 

#### 8. Cool Down

Once the cakes are out of the oven, tap them gently again on the counter. This helps prevent shrinkage as they cool. Let them cool in the pans until they’re safe to handle.

#### 9. Whip It Good

While the cakes are cooling, whip the cream with icing sugar and vanilla essence until you reach a glorious, fluffy consistency. 

#### 10. Assemble the Layers

Remove the cakes from their pans and peel off the parchment paper. Slice each cake in half horizontally. Drizzle the cut sides with your prepared sugar syrup, then layer on the macerated strawberries. Top the strawberries with a generous dollop of whipped cream. Repeat this delicious layering process until you've stacked four layers of cake, strawberries, and cream.

#### 11. Frost and Decorate

Cover the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream, creating a smooth and dreamy finish. For the grand finale, decorate the top with chocolate shavings and whole cherries or strawberries.

#### 12. Chill and Enjoy

Pop the finished masterpiece into the fridge until the cream has set. Get ready to indulge in your delicious strawberry layer cake. Enjoy every delightful bite!
