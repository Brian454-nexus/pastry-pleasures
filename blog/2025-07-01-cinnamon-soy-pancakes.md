It’s been raining every morning, consistently, for the past two weeks. Meaning I have good reason to just make pancakes for breakfast and have enough left over for snacking throughout the day.

The best part about these pancakes is that they are suitable for all dietary options as they contain no eggs or dairy milk.

Let’s get on it.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 1 & 1/2 cup all purpose flour
> * 3 tablespoons white sugar
> * 1/4 teaspoon salt
> * 1/2 teaspoon Pradip Cinnamon Powder
> * 2 tablespoons oil
> * 2 cups Soy Milk



***Method***

In a large bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon powder.

Add the oil and then the soy milk. Whisk until all ingredients are combined and the pancake batter is lump free.

Heat up your frying pan and add about a tablespoon of oil.

Spread the oil with a serviette. This will also help remove excess oil.

Pour about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the pan and swirl the pan to spread it.

Let the pancake cook on medium heat for about 1 minute on each side. Repeat with the rest of the batter.
