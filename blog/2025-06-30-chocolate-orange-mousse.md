Doesnâ€™t the title of this just roll off your tongue? Makes me salivate thinking about it.

I am not a big chocolate person. In fact the general idea of having chocolate does not appeal to me. So what I like to do is have a flavoured chocolate item. Makes it easier on my palette as Iâ€™ll concentrate on the flavour as opposed to the chocolate itself.

Pradip flavours have made my life easy. They make everything so easy that you need not worry about recipes when their products are easily available.

Being that the holidays are here, my younger cousins love coming over so we can bake something. They always want a recipe that they can do with little to no supervision whatsoever and thus the inception of this beauties. Its quick and easy and everyone is guaranteed to enjoy.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 200g dark chocolate
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip Orange essence
> * 1 tablespoon orange juice
> * 2 cups whipping or heavy cream
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip gelatin
> * Orange zest and orange slices to garnish (optional)

***Method***

Cut the dark chocolate into small bits (the smaller they are, the easier it will be to melt).

In a small bowl, mix the orange juice and pradip gelatin and stirring until everything dissolves. Let it sit for at least five minutes to form a paste.

mix them together

let it sit for a while

Add 1 cup of your whipped cream (I use non dairy that is presweetened) to a saucepan and let the cream come to a boil on low heat. Add the dark chocolate to the hot cream and let the mix combine completely so as to form ganache.Remove from the heat, add the gelatin and stir completely to dissolve the gelatin. Set aside to cool.

Whip the remaining cream to form soft peaks.

Add a third (1/3) of the whipped cream to the chocolate mix and stir until the white streaks disappear.

I have a feeling this bowl is older than me ðŸ™‚

Add half of the remaining cream to the chocolate mix and fold in the mix until the streaks disappear. Repeat with the remaining cream.

The mousse is now ready.
