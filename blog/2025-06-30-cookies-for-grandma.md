Grandparents are best known for the older guys who give us treats. Growing up I always looked up to days when both my grandmas would visit, whether together or separately, because it meant they would bring one of two things if not both. AVOCADOS and FERMENTED PORRIDGE. Visiting them only meant I would get avocados only, so I preferred if they came over.

My grandfather on the side, always had macadamia nuts in his cabinet. He’d call each one of us and give us macadamias and to this date, macadamias remain my favourite treat. He stopped when we got older but I reminded him of it the other day and he was kind enough to bring me a tonne of macadamias. God bless his soul.

We were going on a road trip and I decided to make some simple vanilla cookies for my grandmother. She loved them but still fed 98% of them to us. What are grandmas for?

> ***Ingredients***
>
> 1. 250 grams margarine or butter
> 2. 75 grams caster sugar
> 3. 25o grams all-purpose flour
> 4. 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
> 5. 3 teaspoons milk
> 6. 1 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla

***Method***

1. Pre-heat your oven at 180 degrees Celsius
2. Grease a baking sheet and place grease proof/parchment paper on it. Alternatively grease and dust the baking sheet with flour.
3. In a bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together.
4. In a second bowl, soften the butter and add the caster sugar to it, until pale and fluffy.
5. When the margarine and sugar are well mixed, add the flour mix and the pradip vanilla and milk and mix until everything is well combined.
6. Scoop a tablespoon or less or more and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hand, place on the baking sheet. Do this with all the cookie dough. Should give 12-30 cookies depending on the preferred size. You can also opt to use a piping bag, with or without a nozzle.
7. Bake for 15-20 minutes. The edges of the cookies should be firm and the center soft to touch, while removing.
8. Set aside to cool as they firm up.
9. Enjoy!
