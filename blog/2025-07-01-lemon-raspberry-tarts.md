Hello!!

It’s been a minute. A long unwarranted minute. Feels more like a decade since I was last on my blog and it kinda sucks. Work, school and life just caught up with me and with the blink of an eye, close to two months had passed without me being in the kitchen to create. I’ve gotten enough emails and DM’s asking if I could share certain recipes and I’ll try post them all as soon as I possibly can, but I sure will post.

One lovely reader and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/s_eshi/) follower asked for desserts and sweets recipes that she can try out during the Ramadan season. She wants a recipe that’s simple enough to follow, yet amazing for the entire family. And these raspberry tarts are nothing short of fantastic.

While in baking school, we were taught how to make tarts and surprising enough, I only make them once or twice a year, as it never crosses my mind to do them. The tart recipe is from my lovely instructor at Cakes.co.ke.

To make the filling, I’ll be using plain non dairy whipped cream and topping it with full raspberries to brighten the tarts. Feel free to top and garnish your tarts with anything so as to make them much more different and lovely.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> ***For the tarts***
>
> * 150g margarine
> * ½ cups sugar
> * 2 cups plain flour
> * 1/2 teaspoon Pradip lemon flavour
> * 1 egg white

> * Whipping Cream

> * Raspberries
> * Mint Sprigs

***Method*** 

In a saucepan on low heat, melt the margarine and sugar until well combined. The mix will look a little gritty but not to worry. Add the lemon flavour.

Set aside for a minute or so to cool down and then add sifted flour to it. Mix well and then add the egg white to bind and form into a dough.  Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it in cling film and set it in the fridge for 30 minutes.

Depending on the size of tarts, grease a cupcake tray and set aside.

Take the dough from the fridge and dust your surface with flour, then roll the dough thinly. Cut into desired size and gently place into cupcake holes (if you’re too fast they might break!!)

Poke the tarts with a fork and let them sit in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking. Poking the tarts allows for the steam to escape as the tarts bake. It will also ensure the tarts do not rise and become shallow.

Preheat your oven at 180 degrees Celsius while the tarts are chilling. Take the tarts out of the fridge and bake for 18 minutes. Any longer and they become biscuits. Let them cool before decorating. ![IMG_0535](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_0535.jpg?w=750)

Once the tarts are cool, fill them with whipped cream and garnish with raspberries and a sprig of mint.

Ps: The tart dough can be frozen for up to a month and just enough taken out of the fridge to use for the day. Ensure to defrost overnight before attempting to roll.
