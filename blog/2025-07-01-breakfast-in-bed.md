***Happy Valentine’s Day!!***

Though technically it’s not until tomorrow, but does that mean we can’t start showing extra love a little early? There’s genuinely nothing wrong with that.

If anything, we should also be ready to make them even after tomorrow because we love those we are with right?!

These pancakes are the perfect way to surprise the love for breakfast in bed. They are simple to make and require no skill or time to prepare.

So here we go…

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 2 eggs
> * 2 &1/4 cups buttermilk
> * 1/3 cup vegetable oil
> * 2 cups all purpose flour
> * 2 tablespoons Pradip Cocoa Powder
> * 1/2 cup Pradip corn starch/flour
> * 1 & 1/2 teaspoons Pradip baking powder
> * 1/2 cups white sugar
> * 1/2 teaspoon Pradip 4R
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip Vanilla – optional

***Method***

Put 2 cups all purpose flour in a large bowl. Add the corn flour and the cocoa powder, then whisk to mix well together.

Add the sugar, baking powder and powder food colour (4R), while whisking so as to blend everything together.

Add the eggs and stir. Then add the oil and finally add the buttermilk, a little at a time, to get the desired consistency. If you’re adding vanilla essence, this would be the perfect time to do so.

Keep whisking until the mixture is smooth and has no lumps in it.

Heat up your pan and put about a tablespoon of oil, swirling the pan to grease it all over.

Remove the oil.

Pour about quarter a cup of the batter onto the pan and spread it a little to make an even circle. Let it heat up for about 1 or 2 minutes before flipping it. It should be nice and bubbly. Once you flip it, let it cook for about a minute and remove from the pan. (Poke the pancake a bit to make sure it cooked through)

Enjoy the pancakes warm.

> The [Pradip](https://www.facebook.com/PradipEL/) 4R food colour and the cocoa powder combination in the pancakes give these a wonderful chocolatey taste and it’s vibrant colour. I would recommend using them together to get the right velvety colour, texture and flavour.

Ps: If you’re strapped for time, pour the ingredients in a blender and mix everything up. Should be ready to cook in 2 minutes.
