I almost didn’t have a post up today! But I made myself a promise in January that I have to put a post and a video up every week, despite the circumstances. It’s raining right now, and I have the worst cough right about now. It kept me up most of the night but surprisingly enough, I wake up feeling much better!

I made these mandazis yesterday as I had the energy and was really craving mandazis and a coconut (I know, odd combination, probably no correlation, but I was and we shall accept it).

I had this Vanilla Coconut Flavour that I had received from [Pradip](https://www.facebook.com/PradipEL/) that I was dying to try out, and why not with mandazis.

The powder flavour is quite rich and amazing, and if you’re a big fan of coconut flavoured products, this powder is your ticket to flavour heaven.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 2 cups all purpose flour, plus extra for kneading and dusting
> * 1/4 cup white sugar
> * 1/2 cup Pradip Corn flour
> * 2 teaspoons Pradip Baking Powder
> * 2 teaspoons Pradip Vanilla Coconut Flavour
> * 1/4 teaspoon salt
> * 2 eggs
> * 1/3 cup Oil
> * 1 cup WARM water (can use milk)

***Method***

Place the all purpose flour in a deep bowl, and add the sugar, corn flour, baking powder, vanilla coconut flavour and salt, stirring thoroughly after each addition.

Next, add the eggs and the oil, and mix through. Add the warm water, a little at a time, while stirring so as it starts to form a dough, If it starts to become sticky, add a little flour sparingly, so it doesn’t become dry and tough.

Dust your countertop with flour

Then knead the dough until its soft and does not stick to the counter or to your hands.

Place the dough. Cover the bowl with cling film, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.

Dust your countertop with dough once again, and knead the rested dough a little.

Roll the dough to desired thickness.

Using a knife, cut the dough into strips.

Deep fry the mandazis until golden,
