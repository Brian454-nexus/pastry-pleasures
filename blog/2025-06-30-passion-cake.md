This has been an amazingly and beautiful week. The weather was constantly great, and the orders from you lovelies just keep coming, booking me solid for the entire month

My mother was craving cake. A fruity cake to be precise and I had to be quick about it.

The beauty of this passion cake is that it incorporates both the fruit and the Pradip Passion flavour, which smells beyond amazing. The fruits make the cake extra moist and when mixed with the milk, they add a beautiful somewhat tangy flavour to the cake. The Pradip Passion flavour brings out the fruit flavour more and gives an absolutely beautiful aroma to the cake and house in general.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * 125g margarine
> * 1/2 cup granulated white sugar
> * 2 eggs
> * 1/4 cup milk
> * 1/2 cup passion fruit pulp
> * 1 & 1/4 cup flour
> * 1/2 teaspoon passion essence
> * 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
>
> ***For the glaze*** 
>
> * 50g white chocolate, cut into small bits and melted
> * 2 tablespoon icing sugar
> * 1/4 cup passion fruit pulp

***Method***

Preheat your oven at 180 degrees Celsius

Grease as dust your 600g loaf pan (can use any baking tin of choice).

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together).

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

Add your eggs one at a time to the margarine mixture, until incorporated.

Add the Pradip passion flavour. You can add or reduce the quantity by 1/4 teaspoon to suit you. The flavour is quite strong so be careful.

Add the Passion fruit pulp

Slowly add your flour mix and milk into the margarine and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared loaf tin and bake for 30-40 minutes.
