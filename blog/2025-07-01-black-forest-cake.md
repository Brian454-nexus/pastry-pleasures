On the 5th Day of Christmas, there was a Black Forest Cake. If you could check my Instagram DMs, I get asked for this recipe more times a week than expected. I have been requested and begged for it and although it was planned for to be posted eventually, I caved sooner than I had expected. Probably because the Christmas Spirit was in me!

I kid you not when I say the Pradip cocoa powder bring this Black Forest to life so quickly, considering how little cocoa powder is actually required to make it. All you need is 1/3 cup of cocoa for a kilo of cake and this makes the cake quite rich. You can, however, use 1/2 cup Pradip cocoa powder and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, (instead of 2/3 flour) to make it even richer.

> ***Ingredients – makes an 8″ cake or 1kg cake***
>
> ***For the cake*** 
>
> * 7 eggs
> * 1 cup sugar
> * 2/3 cup flour
> * 1/3 cup Pradip cocoa
> * 1 teaspoon Pradip baking powder
>
> ***For moistening***
>
> * Simple Syrup
>
> ***For filling, deco and garnishing***
>
> * Dark chocolate for garnishing
> * 2 cups whipping cream
> * Strawberries or cherries

***Method***

* Preheat oven to 180C
* Grease and line baking sheet with greaseproof paper
* Sift the flour cocoa and baking powder together and set aside.
* Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Place the egg whites in a large bowl and the yolks in a smaller bowl.
* Whisk the egg whites until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Use a metal spoon to test if ready by scooping the whites and turning the spoon upside down. If the eggs don’t fall, it’s ready.
* Add the yolks and whisk thoroughly
* Add the sugar and whisk thoroughly
* Add the flour mixture a little at a time using the folding in method to ensure a lot of air is in the cake batter.
* Pour into the prepared baking pan and bake for 40 minutes or until knife test is clean
* Once ready set it aside to cool for 1hr before decorating

***To Decorate***

* When cake is cool whisk the whipping cream until stiff peaks.
* Cut the cake into two or three layers and moisten each layer with the juice until the cakes are well moistened.
* Pour some whipped cream onto one layer and smoothen it. Then place some chopped strawberries on top.
* Then place the other layer and decorate with remaining whipped cream. Use the dark chocolate to garnish and place some of the strawberries to finish up the look
