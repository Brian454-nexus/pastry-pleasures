On the 4th Day of Christmas, there was a swiss roll, a swiss roll that had been requested for all year. This was one of the most requested recipes since the beginning of the blog and even more after starting out the youtube channel.

Christmas seemed like the best time to post this up as it is not only a simple dessert to make but also something wonderful to try out.

We all know Pembe flour is a household name and during the Christmas period, we get to stock up on all-purpose flour, so why not try making a swiss roll and having our families enjoy. It’s bound to be a hit and an excellent surprise as you can customise it however you’d like to suit your families desires.

> ***Ingredients***
>
> ***To make the swiss roll***
>
> * 5 Eggs
> * 1/2 cup sugar
> * 3/4 cup Pembe all purpose flour
> * 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
>
> ***To moisten the swiss roll***
>
> * Simple Syrup
>
> ***For filling and garnishing***
>
> * Strawberries
> * Whipping cream
>
> ***Other necessary items***
>
> * Damp towel slightly bigger than baking sheet

***Method***

* Preheat oven to 180C
* Grease and line baking sheet with greaseproof paper ensure it hangs on the sides\
  Sift the flour and baking powder together and set aside.
* Separate the egg whites from the yolks, adding the whites to a large bowl and the yolks into a small bowl.
* Whisk the egg whites until fluffy and stiff peaks form. Use a metal spoon to test if ready by scooping the whites and turning the spoon upside down. If the eggs don’t fall, it’s ready.
* Add the yolks and whisk thoroughly
* Add the sugar and whisk thoroughly
* Add the flour mixture a little at a time using the folding in method to ensure a lot of air is in the cake batter.
* Pour into the prepared baking pan and bake for 15 minutes or until knife test is clean
* Once ready set it aside to cool for 5-10minutes then remove from the sheet using the greaseproof paper, peel of the greaseproof paper, place on the damp towel and roll it up using the damp towel. If you wrap the swiss roll when it’s too hot or completely cool, it may break, so it is necessary to just allow it to cool a bit.
* Let it sit for 10 minutes then unwrap the towel.
* Brush it with juice apply whipping cream and place your fruits and roll it up again. garnish the top with cream and fruits
