Cupcakes are my all time favourite thing to bake. They are just a beautiful thing to eat and decorate. Before joining a baking school, or even thinking of ever taking baking seriously, I used to make cupcakes and sell them mainly to my dad and sister (they always carry something to eat while at work).

I mainly did cupcakes because you can decorate them easily with or without a piping bag, or any skill. Cupcakes can turn instantly gorgeous just from toppings hence my favourite thing to bake.

We had guests over the weekend (hence the late post â€“ please forgive me ðŸ™‚ ), so with restricted time on my hands, I made two cakes and cupcakes, because itâ€™s only a meeting and not a celebration, if it does not end with cake!! My cousins only expect two things from me, cake and samosas, it is the reason I am their favourite! Yes I said it!!

This recipe is quite easy to follow, and the cupcakes take a really short time to bake so you canâ€™t go wrong with them.

>
> ***For the toppings***
>
> * Good quality whipping cream

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Line your cupcake sheet with cupcake liners, Alternatively, grease and dust your cupcake sheet well, if not using the liners.

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour (refer toÂ [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/)Â for the importance of sifting them together). Add the chocolate chips.

In a second bowl, soften your margarine with your mixer or a spatula.Â Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.Â Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.Â Add the Vanilla essence.

Slowly add your flour mix and milk into the margarineÂ and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cupcakes lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

When everything is well incorporated, use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to evenly distribute the mix into the cupcake sheet. Bake for 18 â€“ 20 Minutes. You can also check for readiness by inserting a cake tester or a toothpick in the center of a cupcake, if the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are ready.
