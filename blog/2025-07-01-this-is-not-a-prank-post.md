Itâ€™s April Fools Day, and also Easter Sunday. So letâ€™s treat ourselves to making this lovely pizza.

Iâ€™m not a fan of pizza. To put it into perspective, I probably have Pizza once or twice a year. Mainly because I am not a cheese fan and also because I do know like how most pizza places make really dry pizzas with little to no toppings (but you can always request for extra toppings â€“ but the extra toppings are usually none existent as well so itâ€™s almost pointless.

This year on the other hand, Iâ€™ve been craving pizza on an almost weekly basis. Which is quite strange since I wouldnâ€™t have been bothered to get Pizza 100 days ago.

Luckily, a chef friend volunteered to teach me how to make pizza and I swear this is the most delicious thing I have ever tasted.

I have possibly and probably made one once every week for the past two months. ðŸ˜€ I am not complaining though! Itâ€™s Delish!!

In a large clean bowl, add the chicken, spices, salt, onion, garlic, ginger, Dhania, oil, vinegar and the yoghurt, and stir to combine. Cover the bowl in cling film and let the chicken marinate for 20-30 minutes.

> ***For the pizza dough***
>
> * 1.5 cups all purpose flour ( plus extra for kneading and dusting)
> * 1.5 tablespoons yeast
> * 1 tablespoon sugar
> * 1/2 teaspoon salt
> * 1 tablespoon oil
> * Warm water

![pizza-with-wangeci-154.jpg](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-154-e1522560433999.jpg?w=750)

In a large bowl, mix in the flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Stir to combine then add the oil. Add warm water, a little at a time, and mix to form a dough. If itâ€™s too sticky, add more flour.

Dust the counter top with a little flour and knead the dough until soft, and doesnâ€™t stick to the counter or to your hands.

I used a total of two cups of flour to make my pizza dough. (1.5 cups initially, then used 1/2 cup for kneading and dusting the counter )

Drizzle some oil into a clean bowl and place the dough. Cover the bowl with cling film and let the dough proof for 30 minutes

***Back to the Chicken***

![pizza with Wangeci-308](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-308.jpg?w=750)

Cook the chicken on medium heat until ready. If the marinade sauce is in excess when the chicken is ready, remove the chicken from the extra sauce.

***Making the Pizza***

Now that the dough is well risen and the chicken is ready, letâ€™s assemble. Preheat your oven at 200Â°C

> ***Ingredients***
>
> * Pizza dough
> * Pizza sauce (Iâ€™m using store bought sauce)
> * Cooked chicken
> * Grated mozzarella (I use about 300g of cheese)
> * sweet corn
> * fresh coriander

Remove the pizza dough from the bowl, and deflate it. Knead it a little to remove excess air from it.

![pizza with Wangeci-414](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-414.jpg?w=750)

Roll the dough to desired size and thickness. I like to roll my dough a little thin, as it will rise again in the oven.

Transfer the dough to the baking tray. Iâ€™m using the oven tray lined with lightly greased baking/grease proof paper.

Grab a fork and poke holes into the dough. This is essential as it will help ensure the dough doesnâ€™t bubble up while baking. This also helps the dough to not become soggy.

![pizza with Wangeci-430](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-430.jpg?w=750)

Add the pizza sauce. I love to spread a generous amount of the sauce on the pizza dough so the pizza is tasteful all over.

![pizza with Wangeci-442](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-442.jpg?w=750)

Add half of the mozzarella. I find that adding the cheese at this point makes the pizza more stringy and its wonderful for a cheese lover.

![pizza with Wangeci-453](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-453.jpg?w=750)

Add the chicken toppings.

Add the sweet corn

Add the remaining mozzarella.

Top with fresh dhania

![pizza with Wangeci-474](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pizza-with-wangeci-474.jpg?w=750)

Pop the pizza into the oven for 15 minutes. I bake the pizza on the middle rack so that the heat is evenly distributed. the edges of the crust should have browned.

Once the pizza is ready, remove from the oven, slice and serve warm!

Enjoy the pizza.
