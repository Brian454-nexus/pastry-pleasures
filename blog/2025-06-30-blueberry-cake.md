  This is the cake that will leave your tastebuds feeling some type of way.
  You’ll want to give this cake some TLC when you are done baking it. It
  seriously is good.


  I’ve had blueberry cakes in the past and some have been a bit disappointing. There’s a current trend of using food Colour on cakes as opposed to the natural fruit to make the cakes.


  This recipe is simple to the core and it leaves your house smelling glorious. You will want to eat this cake as slowly as possible, so as to give your taste buds all the love in the world.


  If you don’t believe me, try it. It will be a whole lot of bliss with every bite.

**Ingredients** 

**For the cake**

* 250 grams margarine/butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup milk
* 3/4 cup blueberry puree
* 4 eggs
* 1 & 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 & 1/4 cups flour

**For the cream**

* 200 grams melted white chocolate
* 280 grams margarine or butter
* 1 & 3/4 cups icing sugar
* 2 tablespoons blueberry puree

**For the purée** 

* 450 grams blueberries
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1/8 cup sugar

To make the purée, add the blueberries, sugar and water in a sufuria and let simmer for five minutes whisking consecutively. It should start to thicken. Take off heat and let it cool.

**Method**

Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Grease and dust your baking tin.

In one bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour. (refer to [this](https://pastrypleasures.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/lemon-cake/) for the importance of sifting them together.)

In a second bowl, soften your butter or margarine with your mixer or spatula. Add the sugar and mix until well incorporated.

The mixture will turn from yellow and heavy, to a pale white and fluffy texture.

From This

This step is important as it dictates the texture that your cake will have.

to this

Add your eggs one at a time to the butter mixture, until incorporated.

I am doing double the recipe

Add your Blueberry puree

Slowly add your flour and milk into the butter and eggs mix. This should be done alternating so as to incorporate air into the batter and make your cake lighter as opposed to dense. Starting and ending with flour.

Once everything is well incorporated, pour the batter into your prepared baking tin and bake for 40-50 minutes. If baking in 2 tins, bake for 25 minutes.

Should look like this

**Making the cream**

Mix together the margarine and the icing sugar in a bowl, until well incorporated.

Add the melted chocolate.

Add the blueberry puree now or later.

If you baked in one tin, slice the cake into two or three layers.

Put some frosting on the first layer, according to your preference.

When done layering, cover your entire cake with a bit of icing, this is the crumb coat. It ensures that the finished look is much neater without the crumbs showing.

Crumb coat

Pop the cake into the fridge for 10 to 30 minutes for the cream to set.

Remove cake from the fridge, cover with frosting and garnish as desired.
